Scheduling courses is normally a problem that any university has to face at the start of an academic term, and this has taken quite a heavy toll on both student satisfaction and administrative efficiency. The main aim of the project is the development of a far more dynamic course registration system, which ought to have an approach to scheduling that takes the students as the main actors in fairness and efficiency. The present system doesn't leave room for the needs of students and their academic progressions, leading to overbooked courses and conflicts in scheduling.

The project proposes a two-phase course enrollment process. In the first phase, the system will permit students to schedule the courses they would like to take, listing them "in progress" during the first week of the term. Here, in this phase, the system keeps track of all course preferences without fully placing students into those courses. At the end of the initial scheduling period, the second phase will begin, wherein course placement will be finalized based on predefined guidelines. The prioritization would be based on both the total credit hours of students as well as on their most need for a course. This will ensure that no senior student or those on tight tracks are left without courses they need.

The actual capacity issue would further be mitigated based on real-time data provided to university administrators regarding course demand through this system. From this trend, the university can decide whether to request additional sections for the course or, if the course is not urgent to the students, ask them to adjust their schedules. In that way, resources will be properly utilized and no student will lag behind in their academic schedules. It provides priority and enrollment to the students with the least human interference to avoid human errors for a smoother and more transparent course registration experience.

This project ultimately will allow the universities to reduce the scheduling conflicts, increase student satisfaction, and better manage course capacities in keeping with the academic progress and requirement of students.
